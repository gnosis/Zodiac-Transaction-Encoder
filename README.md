## Zodiac Transaction Encoder

A little webapp that fetches the ABI for an address (if available) or parses ABI json, shows the functions available, and when one is selected, displays the inputs (if any). Once the necessary info for a function is input, the call data is returned and made copy-able. [Available here](https://abi.gnosisguild.eth.link/).
