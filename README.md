## ABI parsing and function encoding demo

A little webapp that parses ABI json, shows the functions available, and when one is selected, displays the inputs (if any). Once the necessary info for a function is input, the call data is returned and made copy-able. [Demo available here](https://abi-encoder-demo.vercel.app/).

### Local Dev

Clone the repo then run `npm install` then `npm run dev`. Run tests with `npm run test`.

This was built with node v15.8.0.
